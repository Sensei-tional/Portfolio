        I have spent the past 2 year developing on myself to  further strength my skillset so that I would be able to cement myself within
        the Games Industry. To do this, I have been learning and understanding the standards which the industry use and making sure to
        excel in my endeavours inside the o ce and also outside by committing myself to learn from others around me and teaching
        myself skills to further my knowledge and understanding. This is something that I feel like I have achieved and I will continue to
        push myself to become an individual that will be an even greater asset.
