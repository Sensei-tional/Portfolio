    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I have spent the past 2 year developing on myself to  further strength my skillset so that I would be able to cement myself within
        the Games Industry. To do this, I have been learning and understanding the standards to which the industry use and making sure to
        excel in my endeavours inside and outside of work by committing myself to learn from others around me and becoming more proficient
        at self-teaching. This is something that I feel like I have achieved and I will continue to
        push in the years to come.
